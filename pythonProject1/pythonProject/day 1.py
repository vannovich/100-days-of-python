Semptember 20th 2029
I am signing upfor Replit's 100 days of python
Challenge
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding
along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day
I'llbe using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do
this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses
for not coding from middle of a field!
I am feeling Excited
